## ⚠️ Problem Statement

### The Challenge

Mainstream restaurant discovery platforms focus on popular, well-known establishments that are often:
- **Overcrowded** 🚶‍♂️ - Long wait times and diminished dining experiences
- **Predictable** 🔄 - Same restaurants appearing in every search
- **Limited** 🚫 - Missing out on authentic, hidden culinary gems

The best culinary experiences are frequently found in:
- 🏘️ Small alleys and side streets
- 🏪 Unassuming local shops
- 🗺️ Neighborhood spots not listed on major apps
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family-owned establishments with authentic recipes

These hidden gems offer unique flavors and authentic experiences but remain undiscovered by most food enthusiasts.
