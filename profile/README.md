# Snappie - Product Overview

## Executive Summary

**Snappie: Hidden Gems Kulinar** is a gamified mobile application that transforms restaurant discovery into an engaging adventure. Unlike traditional directory apps, Snappie rewards users for exploring unique, lesser-known eateries through a points-based system, level progression, and real-world rewards.

## Problem Statement

### The Challenge

Mainstream restaurant discovery platforms focus on popular, well-known establishments that are often:
- **Overcrowded** - Long wait times and diminished dining experiences
- **Predictable** - Same restaurants appearing in every search
- **Limited** - Missing out on authentic, hidden culinary gems

The best culinary experiences are frequently found in:
- Small alleys and side streets
- Unassuming local shops
- Neighborhood spots not listed on major apps
- Family-owned establishments with authentic recipes

These hidden gems offer unique flavors and authentic experiences but remain undiscovered by most food enthusiasts.
